        "**1. What is Python, and why is it popular?** Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it a great choice for beginners and complex applications alike.\n",
        "\n",
        "Its popularity stems from several factors:\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplicity and Readability: Its clear syntax, often described as similar to English, allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vast Ecosystem and Libraries: It has a massive standard library and numerous third-party frameworks (like Django, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow) that support almost every programming task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Versatility: Python is used in various domains, including web development, data science/machine learning, automation/scripting, and software testing.\n",

        "**2. What is an interpreter in Python? **An interpreter is a program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into machine-code instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the interpreter reads the source code line-by-line, translating each line into machine code and executing it immediately. This process allows for rapid prototyping and makes debugging easier, as execution stops as soon as an error is encountered.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?** Pre-defined keywords or reserved words are special words that have a fixed, specific meaning and function within the Python language structure. They are fundamental to defining the syntax and logic of Python code. Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, import, return, True, False, and None.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Can keywords be used as variable names?** No keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifier in Python. Since they have a fixed meaning to the interpreter, using them as identifiers would confuse the interpreter and lead to a SyntaxError.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is mutability in Python? **Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed or modified after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets) can have their internal state altered without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable objects (e.g., tuples, strings, integers, floats) cannot be changed after creation. Any \"modification\" to an immutable object actually results in a new object being created in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?** The difference lies in their design and intended use:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are designed to be dynamic collections where elements are frequently added, removed, or changed. This mutability allows for efficient in-place modification without the overhead of creating new objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are designed to represent fixed collections of related data (like coordinates or a record). Their immutability provides a guarantee that the data within them will not change throughout the program's execution, making them safer to use as dictionary keys or for data integrity checks. Immutability also makes tuples slightly faster and more memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        ".**7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?**OperatorPurposeComparison Type== (Equality)Checks if the values of two objects are equal.Value comparison.is (Identity)Checks if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.Memory Address (ID) comparison.Example: Two separate lists, a = [1, 2] and b = [1, 2], would return a == b as True (same value) but a is b as False (different objects in memory)\n",
        "\n",
        ".**8. What are logical operators in Python?** Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements (Boolean values: True or False) to determine the logic between them. Python has three primary logical operators:and: Returns True if both operands are True.or: Returns True if at least one operand is True.not: Acts as a negation, returning the opposite of the operand's Boolean value.🔄 Type Casting and Control Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is type casting in Python?** Type casting (or type conversion) is the process of converting a variable or value from one data type to another. This is often necessary when performing operations that require specific data types, such as converting a string input into an integer for arithmetic calculations. Python provides built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), and list() for this purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit type conversion, also known as type coercion, is performed automatically by the Python interpreter to avoid data loss. It occurs when different data types are used together in an operation. For example, when you add an integer and a float such as 5 + 2.5, Python automatically converts the integer into a float, resulting in 7.5. This happens without any manual intervention by the programmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, explicit type conversion, also called type casting, is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions like int(), float(), or str(). It allows the programmer to intentionally change the data type, though it can sometimes lead to data loss. For instance, using int(\"123\") converts the string \"123\" into the integer 123, or converting a float to an integer (like int(9.8)) would remove the decimal part.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python? **The purpose of conditional statements (if, elif, else) is to execute a specific block of code only if a certain condition (or set of conditions) is met. They allow a program to make decisions and follow different paths of execution based on the state of variables or input, which is fundamental for creating dynamic and functional programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. How does the elif statement work?** The elif (short for \"else if\") statement is used to check for an additional condition only if the preceding if condition (and any preceding elif conditions) evaluated to False.It allows you to chain multiple conditions together. Only the code block associated with the first True condition in the entire if-elif-else block will execute. If an elif condition is True, its block executes, and the rest of the chain is skipped.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is the difference between for and while loops?** **In Python, both for and while loops **are used to repeat a block of code, but they differ in how the iteration is controlled. A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or any other iterable object. It is mainly used for definite iteration, meaning the number of iterations is known beforehand—usually determined by the length of the sequence or a fixed range. For example, a for loop is ideal when processing every item in a list or when you want to repeat a task a specific number of times using the range() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a while loop is used for indefinite iteration, where the number of repetitions is not known in advance. The loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition remains True, and it stops once the condition becomes False. This makes while loops useful in situations where the end point depends on a changing condition, such as waiting for user input, checking a system status, or searching for an item until it is found.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.** A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and the loop needs to continue until a specific external condition is met.Scenario: Creating a menu-driven program or validating user input.Imagine a program that keeps prompting a user to enter a valid password or choose an option from a menu. The program doesn't know how many times the user will enter invalid input.Python# The loop continues indefinitely until the user enters the correct password password = \"\" while password != \"secret123\": password = input(\"Enter your password: \") if password != \"secret123\": print(\"Incorrect password. Try again.\")\n",

        "print(\"Access granted!\") A for loop would be cumbersome here because you'd have to pre-define a maximum number of attempts, which defeats the purpose of continuously allowing retries."
