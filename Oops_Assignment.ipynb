        "**1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which bundle data (variables) and behavior (methods) together. OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities and improves code reusability, scalability, security, and maintainability using principles like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is a class in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have. A class itself does not occupy memory for data until objects are created from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is an object in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and occupies memory. Objects can access the class’s variables and methods and have their own state (values).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. It hides unnecessary implementation details and shows only essential features, usually achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation, on the other hand, focuses on how data is protected. It bundles data and methods together and restricts direct access to variables using access modifiers or conventions (like private variables).\n",
        "In short, abstraction hides complexity, while encapsulation hides data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python that start and end with __. They allow objects to interact with built-in functions and operators. Examples include __init__, __str__, __len__, and __add__.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child class) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and supports hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows the same method name to behave differently depending on the object calling it. This is achieved through method overriding, operator overloading, or duck typing in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is achieved by:\n",
        "\n",
        "Using private variables (__variable)\n",
        "\n",
        "Using protected variables (_variable)\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessing data via getter and setter methods\n",
        "Python relies on naming conventions rather than strict access control.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is a special method named __init__ that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object’s data members.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What are class methods and static methods in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods are defined using @classmethod and take cls as the first parameter. They can modify class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Static methods are defined using @staticmethod and do not take self or cls. They behave like normal functions but belong to the class namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading. Instead, it achieves similar behavior using default arguments, *args, and **kwargs to handle different parameter combinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that already exists in the parent class. The method name and parameters must be the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is a property decorator in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute. It is mainly used to implement getter, setter, and deleter methods while maintaining encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism increases flexibility and scalability. It allows the same interface to be used for different data types or classes, making code easier to extend and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. What is an abstract class in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains one or more abstract methods. It is defined using the abc module and enforces rules that child classes must follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What are the advantages of OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP provides:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "Better data security\n",
        "\n",
        "Easier maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-world modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved scalability and flexibility\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A class variable is shared among all objects of the class, while an instance variable is unique to each object. Changing a class variable affects all instances, but changing an instance variable affects only that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. Python resolves method conflicts using the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ is used to return a readable, user-friendly string representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__ is used to return an official, detailed representation mainly for developers and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The super() function allows a child class to call methods of its parent class. It helps in avoiding code duplication and supports multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is mainly used to release external resources like files or database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?**\n",
        "\n",
        "A staticmethod does not access class or instance data and works like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "A classmethod works with class-level data and takes cls as its first argument, allowing it to modify the class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism works through method overriding, where child classes provide different implementations of the same method defined in the parent class. The method called depends on the object type at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "**24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a single statement. This is done by returning self from methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function. When an object is followed by parentheses, this method gets executed."
