        "\n",
        "**1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "\n",
        "An interpreted language executes code line by line using an interpreter, which makes debugging easier but generally results in slower execution. Python and JavaScript are common examples. A compiled language, on the other hand, converts the entire source code into machine code before execution, which improves performance but makes debugging more complex. Examples include C and C++. In short, interpreted languages prioritize flexibility, while compiled languages prioritize speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program. It allows the program to continue execution or terminate cleanly using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging in Python is a way to record program events, errors, and messages during execution. It helps developers monitor program behavior, debug issues, and maintain applications effectively using the logging module.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is the significance of the del method in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is mainly used to release external resources like files, network connections, or database handles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Using import module imports the entire module and requires the module name to access its members. Using from module import name imports specific members directly, allowing them to be accessed without the module prefix. The former improves clarity and avoids naming conflicts, while the latter provides convenience and shorter code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple exceptions can be handled by specifying them in a tuple within a single except block or by using multiple except blocks to handle different exception types separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The with statement ensures proper acquisition and release of resources such as files. It automatically closes the file once the block execution is complete, even if an exception occurs, making the code safer and cleaner.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading uses multiple threads within a single process and shares the same memory space, making it lightweight but limited by Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). Multiprocessing uses multiple processes with separate memory spaces, allowing true parallel execution but with higher memory and communication overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging helps track errors, monitor application behavior, store execution history, and debug issues in production environments without stopping the program. It is more flexible and powerful than using print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management in Python refers to how Python allocates, uses, and frees memory during program execution. Python manages memory automatically using reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic steps include placing risky code inside a try block, handling errors in one or more except blocks, executing optional code in the else block if no exception occurs, and performing cleanup in the finally block.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management is important to prevent memory leaks, improve performance, and ensure efficient resource usage. Poor memory handling can lead to slow execution and program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The try block contains code that may raise an exception, while the except block catches and handles the exception, preventing abrupt program termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses reference counting to track object usage. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it is automatically deleted. Additionally, Python’s garbage collector handles cyclic references that reference counting alone cannot resolve.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It is useful for separating normal execution code from error-handling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The common logging levels in Python are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. Each level represents the severity of the message being logged.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "os.fork() creates a child process by duplicating the parent process and is available only on Unix-based systems. The multiprocessing module provides a higher-level, cross-platform API for process creation and management, making it safer and more portable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Closing a file releases system resources, ensures data is properly written to disk, and prevents memory leaks or file corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline()?**\n",
        "\n",
        "file.read() reads the entire file content at once, which may consume more memory. file.readline() reads one line at a time, making it more memory-efficient for large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The logging module is used to generate and manage log messages for debugging, monitoring, and auditing application behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as creating, deleting, renaming files, and working with directories.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges include handling large objects, managing circular references, memory fragmentation, and ensuring efficient use of system resources in long-running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "An exception can be raised manually using the raise keyword followed by an exception type and an optional message.\n",
        "\n",
        "**25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading is important for improving responsiveness and performance in I/O-bound applications such as network servers, file handling systems, and GUI applications by allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently."
