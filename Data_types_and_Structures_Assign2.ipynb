        "**3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**\n",
        "A list in Python is mutable, meaning its elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation, and it uses square brackets [] as its syntax. Lists are generally slower than tuples because of their mutability, making them suitable for situations where the data needs to change over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "A tuple, in contrast, is immutable, so once it is created, its elements cannot be modified. It uses parentheses () for its syntax and offers faster performance compared to lists. Because of this immutability, tuples are ideal for storing fixed or constant data that should not be altered.\n",

        "**4. Describe how dictionaries store data.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs using a hash table internally.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Each key is hashed to find its position in memory → fast lookup.\n",

        "Use a set when:\n",
        "\n",
        "You want unique values (no duplicates)\n",

        "\n",
        "A hash table stores data using a hash function to compute an index.\n",
        "Python dictionaries use hash tables internally to provide:\n",

        "Fast insertion and deletion\n",

        "**9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, Python lists can contain mixed data types.\n",

        "**19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Historically, dictionaries did not preserve insertion order (before Python 3.7).\n",
        "Even now, order is not guaranteed for logical use, because:\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieval is based on keys, not positions\n",

        "\n",
        "**20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**\n",
        "A list retrieves data using a numeric index, meaning each element is accessed based on its position in the sequence. This allows fast access with a time complexity of O(1) for direct indexing, making lists ideal when your data is ordered and you need to access items by their position.\n",
        "\n",
        "A dictionary, on the other hand, retrieves data using a key, not a position. Each value is associated with a unique key, allowing fast O(1) lookup on average using a hash table. Dictionaries are therefore preferred when you need to store and retrieve data using meaningful identifiers rather than numeric positions."
